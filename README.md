# VBA-challenge
VBA scripting homework for the Georgia Tech Data Science Bootcamp. 

stock_analysis.bas contains the script that I used to make the calculations in the file Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm

For every stock, the script records:
* the ticker symbol
* yearly change in price
* yearly percent change in price,
* total volume of trading for that stock in the given year 

The script also conditionally formats the change in price so that cells with a positive value appear green and negative values appear red. 

Screenshots can also be found in the top level directory. There is one for 2014, 2015, and 2016. These screenshots just show the first few lines of each excel worksheet in Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm for an easy way to take a look.
